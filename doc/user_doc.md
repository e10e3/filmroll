Filmroll's user documentation
===============================

Main screen
------------

The app's main screen is in three parts: Home, Favourites, and QR code scanning.

They can each be accessed using the navigation bar at the bottom.

The home page shows a search bar and a carousel with currently popular films. The carousel can be
scrolled to show more films. In the search bar, clicking the little cross on the right will clear
the search field.

The favourite page shows a list of the film that were added as favourites. Clicking on one shows
its details.

Finally, the QR code scanning page shows a camera preview. When a QR code is detected, it will show
its details card. It works perhaps a bit too diligently at times. The QR code must only contain the
film to access' identifier, that is a positive integer.

Search screen
--------------

On the home page, the search field can be used to search for films. A search leads to the search screen.

On the search screen, the films corresponding to the query are displayed. Each result features the
film's poster, its title, release year and summary.

Details screen
---------------

The details screen is accessed either by clicking on a film in the search results, in the favourites
list, in the popular films' carousel, recommended films carousel or by scanning a QR code.

The details screen show various pieces of information about the film, like its title, genres, release date, summary...

In addition, it displays a list of actors from the film with their role and a list of crew members with their job.

At the bottom is a scrollable carousel of recommended films in regard to the one being displayed.
Clicking one will who its details.
